HOW GITHUB WORKS

GitHub is a tool for storing files in a way everyone working on the project can see them 
and it keeps a history of the files just in case something gets messed up


Click Repository -> Show in Explorer
	**Note: On Mac this might be Show in Finder
	This should open your file explorer to the Repository is stored
	When you make changes in the directory GitHub will notice and show those file changes 

	For instance when I saved these instructions to in the README.md it was reflected in GitHub Desktop under CHANGES
	Try making your own change to the ReadMe (write Hello at the bottom :)) then save


Now the README is changed on your local computer but how do you get those changes to me?
	-> this is called "pushing" your changes
	-> when you grab someone elses changes and bring them down to your computer that is "pulling"
	-> a group of changes you are "pushing" is called a "commit" that's just telling the computer "these are the specific files I'd like to share with the group" that way you don't need to send every single file you've changes"


So you want to "push" a "commit"
	On the Changes tab you should see a little bar that auto filled with "Update README.md" this is the name of your "commit" in the future name it so you can remember what that specific change was for
	Under that is a description box, you can also you this to elaborite on what the change was for in more depth than the name


Click Commit to main button
	This creates you're commit, well done now we just have to "push" it


Click Push Origin
	This will send your changes up onto the GitHub for all of us to use!


Go back to GitHub:
	https://github.com/Briennaa/Eerie-Tracks

Refesh and you should see the change you made to the README.md
