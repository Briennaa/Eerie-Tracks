HOW GITHUB WORKS

GitHub is a tool for storing files in a way everyone working on the project can see them 
and it keeps a history of the files just in case something gets messed up

Click Repository -> Show in Explorer
	**Note: On Mac this might be Show in Finder
	This should open your file explorer to the Repository is stored
	When you make changes in the directory GitHub will notice and show those file changes
